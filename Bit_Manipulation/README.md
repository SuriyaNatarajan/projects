# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation allows us to solve problems using the binary representation of a number(0,1) .
Using Bitwise operators with other unary operators, we can solve many problems efficiently in terms of time as well as space complexity.
Bitwise operations are faster and used significantly in embedded and firmware programming.
